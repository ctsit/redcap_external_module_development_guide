# EMD-102: A tour through REDCap as an Admin

This guide is a tour of the features used in administering a REDCap system. While REDCap Project's [video library](https://projectredcap.org/resources/videos/) provides excellent instruction in building and managing REDCap projects, it is light on content about running a REDCap system. This document describes many of the commonly used administration features to help new Admins and developers understand how to manage REDCap, converse with Admins, and develop modules for the administrative features.

This document assumes some familiarity with REDCap and access to a REDCap system to try these features. Review VUMC's [REDCap training videos](https://projectredcap.org/resources/videos/) if you do not already have basic REDCap skills. If you do not have access to a REDCap system where you have Admin rights, see [EMD-101: Building a REDCap Development Environment](emd101) to build your own REDCap system.

## Access the Control Center > Configuration Check:

<img class="screenshot" width="261" alt="Configuration Check Menu" src="/assets/img/configuration_check_menu.png">

If your installation is set up correctly, everything should be highlighted in green here. If there is an issue, the problem will be highlighted in red.

<summary>User Settings
</summary>
<br>

## Access the Control Center > User Settings:

<img class="screenshot" width="267" alt="User Settings" src="/assets/img/user_settings_menu.png">

These user setting are important and apply to all users, except REDCap Admins. For example: can users create their own projects, or do they need to request a new project that the REDCap Admins have to approve? Can users move their own projects into production, or do the REDCap Admins have to approve their request? Should unused/inactive REDCap accounts be suspended after x number of days of inactivity? Should post-production change requests be automatically approved or should a REDCap Admin approve them first to ensure no data is lost or orphaned?

## Access the Control Center > File Upload Settings:

<img class="screenshot" width="262" alt="File Upload Settings Menu" src="/assets/img/file_upload_settings_menu.png">

<details>
<summary>External Modules
</summary>
<br>

## Access the Control Center > External Modules:

<img class="screenshot" width="259" alt="External Modules Menu" src="/assets/img/external_modules_menu.png">

 On this page, you can see modules that are already downloaded, which modules have updates available, which version of the module you are using, module configurations, and which projects are using these modules. You can also disable any modules here and set custom text for users on the External Modules page in their REDCap projects.

To view modules available already downloaded in your instance: look at the section "Modules Currently Available on this System"

<img class="screenshot" width="723" alt="External Modules - Module Manager" src="/assets/img/external_modules_module_manager.png">
 

Download a few modules by clicking on the blue "View modules available in the REDCap Repo" button.

Try _Admin Dashboard, MySQL Simple Admin, Image Map_, and _Date Calculated Fields_. They are popular and easy to implement.  Click on the blue "Download" button next to the module's name to download it to your REDCap server:

<img class="screenshot" width="1104" alt="External Modules - REDCap Repo" src="/assets/img/external_modules_redcap_repo.png">

Once downloaded, you return to this page to configure the module's global settings by clicking on "Configure" next to the module's name. Global settings include: _Enable module on all projects by default_, _Make module discoverable by users_, and _Module configuration permissions in projects_.

<summary>Modules/Services Configuration
</summary>
<br>

## Access the Control Center > Modules/Services Configuration:

These "Modules" are not External Modules. They are big features in REDCap that are turned off by default.

<img class="screenshot" width="255" alt="Modules/Services Configuration Menu" src="/assets/img/modules_services_configuration_menu.png">

Here is where you enable the use of the survey features in REDCap (i.e., can projects use surveys), URL shortening feature (found on the Survey Distributions Tools page), the Randomization module, the REDCap Shared Library, REDCap API, the Mobile App, the biomedical ontology feature, and many others. 

<img class="screenshot" width="689" alt="Modules/Services Configuration" src="/assets/img/modules_services_configuration.png">

Note: enabling surveys, the Randomization module, the REDCap API and Mobile App does not mean projects/users have to use these features. They only make them available to the users.

<summary>Field Validation Types
</summary>
<br>

## Access the Control Center > Field Validation Types: 

<img class="screenshot" width="272" alt="Field Validation Types Menu" src="/assets/img/field_validation_types_menu.png">

To make these field validations available, click on Enable next to the validation(s) you want to be available.

Note: not all validations will be relevant to your institution/area.

<img class="screenshot" width="463" alt="Field Validation Types" src="/assets/img/field_validation_types.png">

Do you know these are just rows in the MySQL table `redcap_validation_types`? Did you know you can add your own?

<summary>Project Templates
</summary>
<br>

## Access the Control Center > Project Templates: 

<img class="screenshot" width="260" alt="Project Templates Menu" src="/assets/img/project_templates_menu.png">

Project templates are form(s) that other users at your institution can download upon project creation. Some templates are provided by Vanderbilt by default, but you can add your own by clicking on _Add new template_ and choosing which project you want to become a template. Unlike the REDCap Shared Library, these templates are only available upon project creation.

Here is where all pending Move to production requests, API requests and Post-production change requests can be found, that need admin approval. There are several options under _Actions_ to deal with these requests. REDCap will still send an email to the REDCap Admins, unless you uncheck the _Enable email notifications_ for administrators button.

Here you can see which users are REDCap Admins (have all rights and access to all projects and their settings) and who is an account manager, who cannot access all projects and only perform duties related to REDCap accounts (suspend users, delete users, create accounts, etc.)
